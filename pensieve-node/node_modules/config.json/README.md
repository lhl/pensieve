# config.json

[nconf](https://github.com/flatiron/nconf) wrapper that simplifies work
with environment specific configuration files.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bulyshko/config.json.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bulyshko/config.json) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/bulyshko/config.json.png)](https://gemnasium.com/bulyshko/config.json)

**config.json** is easy to use; it:

- loads the default configuration file;
- loads environment specific configuration file and overrides defaults;

and then:

- uses environment variables;
- and command-line arguments to override data from configuration files.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install config.json
```

## Usage

The top-level of `config.json` is a function that loads configuration file with the given `filepath`.

### Create default configuration file

```bash
$ vi sample.json
```

```json
{
  "domain": "www.example.com",
  "mongodb": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 27017
  }
}
```

### Create environment specific configuration file

```bash
$ vi sample.development.json
```

```json
{
  "domain": "dev.example.com"
}
```

**Note:** Environment specific configuration files should be in the same directory as the default one.

### Test config.json in action

```bash
$ vi sample.js
```

```js
var config = require('config.json')('./sample.json');

console.log("domain:", config.domain);
console.log("mongodb:\n",
  "host:", config.mongodb.host, "\n",
  "port:", config.mongodb.port);
```

Run the above script:

```bash
$ NODE_ENV=development node ./sample.js --mongodb:host "dharma.mongohq.com" --mongodb:port 10065
```

The output will be:

```
domain: dev.example.com
mongodb:
 host: dharma.mongohq.com
 port: 10065
```

### Load configuration for the specific environment

Environment can be set by passing `env` argument:

```js
var developmentConfig = require('config.json')('./sample.json', 'development');
var productionConfig = require('config.json')('./sample.json', 'production');
```

### One more thing...

`filepath` can be empty if your configuration file is in the current working directory of the process and is called **config.json**.
